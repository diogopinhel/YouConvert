## Framework - Expo

**YouConvert** is built using **Expo**, an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.

Expo simplifies the development process by providing a set of tools and services that make it easier to build, deploy, and test apps across multiple platforms.

### Why Expo?

- **Cross-Platform**: Write your code once and run it on both iOS and Android.
- **Pre-built Components**: Use Expo's pre-built and customizable components to speed up development.
- **Fast Refresh**: Instantly see the result of your changes without rebuilding the app.
- **Built-in APIs**: Access device features like the camera, location, and notifications without needing native code.
